# Matlab-code-for-Microplastic-ingestion
This code is composed of the three matlab files: the Main function, the lifeHistory, and the Getparameter. The life history script calculates indiviudal life history traits at a given time. 
The Getparameter script saves the parameters of the food chain model used for simulations, which are fixed during simulations. However, varying the parameter tau and Y will give the biomass of preadtor, 
juvenile consumers, adult consumers and resource species.
